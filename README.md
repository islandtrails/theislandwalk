Maps and other resources for The Island Walk, Prince Edward Island.

The Island Walk is a 700 km walking trail that loops around PEI. It takes approximately 32 days to complete if you walk 20-25 kilometres per day. However, not all walkers have to plan to walk 20-25 kms per day. There are many opportunities to complete the Island Walk in sections and spend more time exploring certain areas that appeal to you.

This repository contains GIS data, maps, and other resources related to the walk; for more general information, consult [The Island Walk website](https://theislandwalk.ca).
